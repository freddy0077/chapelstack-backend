# Reporting & Analytics Module (`reporting.md`)

## 1. Overview

The Reporting & Analytics module provides tools to generate, view, and export reports from various data sources across the church management system. It aims to offer insights into church operations, member engagement, financial health, and other key metrics to support decision-making.

Reports can be generated for specific branches or consolidated across multiple branches where appropriate and authorized.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

-   **Data Aggregation**: Collecting and processing data from different modules (e.g., Members, Attendance, Finances, Events).
-   **Report Generation**: Creating pre-defined and customizable reports.
-   **Data Visualization**: Presenting data in understandable formats, including charts, graphs, and tables.
-   **Exporting Reports**: Allowing users to export reports in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV, Excel).
-   **Dashboarding**: Providing customizable dashboards to display key performance indicators (KPIs) and summaries.
-   **Scheduled Reports**: Enabling automated generation and delivery of reports at specified intervals.
-   **Access Control**: Ensuring that users can only access reports and data they are authorized to view.

## 3. Key Report Types (Examples)

*(This module doesn't typically have its own primary data entities but rather queries and aggregates data from other modules.)*

**Member Reports:**
-   Membership statistics (total members, new members, demographics).
-   Member engagement scores (based on attendance, giving, group participation).
-   Birthday and anniversary lists.
-   Directory reports.

**Attendance Reports:**
-   Service/Event attendance trends.
-   Individual attendance history.
-   Absentee reports.
-   Small group attendance summaries.

**Financial Reports:**
-   Giving statements (for members).
-   Contribution summaries by fund, date range, or payment method.
-   Pledge fulfillment reports.
-   Budget vs. Actuals.
-   Expense reports.

**Ministry/Group Reports:**
-   Group membership lists.
-   Ministry activity summaries.

**Administrative Reports:**
-   User activity logs (for auditing).
-   System health checks.

## 4. Core Functionalities & Use Cases

-   Pastor views a dashboard showing weekly attendance trends and giving summaries for their branch.
-   Admin generates year-end giving statements for all members.
-   Small group leader views an attendance report for their group.
-   Finance committee reviews a budget vs. actuals report for the quarter.
-   Staff exports a list of new members from the last month for follow-up.

## 5. API Endpoints

*(Detail the relevant GraphQL queries or REST API endpoints here. These will primarily be query-focused, taking various filter parameters.)*

### GraphQL (Example)

**Queries:**
-   `generateReport(reportType: ReportType!, filter: ReportFilterInput!, outputFormat: OutputFormat): ReportOutput`
    -   `ReportType` (Enum): `MEMBER_LIST`, `ATTENDANCE_SUMMARY`, `FINANCIAL_CONTRIBUTIONS`, etc.
    -   `ReportFilterInput`: A flexible input object with fields like `branchId`, `dateRange`, `fundId`, `groupId`, etc.
    -   `ReportOutput`: Could be a JSON structure representing the report data, or a URL to a generated file.
-   `dashboardData(branchId: ID!, dashboardType: DashboardType!): DashboardData`

*(Alternatively, specific queries for common reports might be more practical than a single generic endpoint.)*
-   `memberDemographicsReport(branchId: ID!, dateRange: DateRangeInput): MemberDemographicsData`
-   `attendanceTrendReport(branchId: ID!, eventTypeId: ID, dateRange: DateRangeInput): AttendanceTrendData`

## 6. Integration with Other Modules

-   **All Modules**: This module reads data from virtually all other modules in the system to generate comprehensive reports.
-   **Branch Management**: Filters reports by branch and allows for consolidated views.

## 7. Security Considerations

-   **Data Privacy**: Strict controls to ensure users only see data they are authorized for (e.g., a branch pastor should only see their branch's data, individual giving data is highly sensitive).
-   **Role-Based Access**: Different roles may have access to different sets of reports or levels of detail.
-   **Secure Export**: Ensuring exported data is handled securely.
-   Performance impact of complex queries on the database.

## 8. Future Considerations

-   Advanced business intelligence (BI) tool integration (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
-   Predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting giving trends, identifying at-risk members).
-   User-configurable report builder interface.
-   Data warehousing solutions for very large datasets or complex analytical queries.
