## Usage

### Running the Seeder

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd chapelstack-backend

# Run the comprehensive member seeder
npm run seed:comprehensive-members
```

### Alternative Methods

```bash
# Direct execution
ts-node src/database/seeders/run-comprehensive-seeder.ts

# Using the seeder class directly
ts-node -e "
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './src/app.module';
import { ComprehensiveMembersSeeder } from './src/database/seeders/comprehensive-members.seeder';

async function run() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(AppModule);
  const seeder = app.get(ComprehensiveMembersSeeder);
  await seeder.seed();
  await app.close();
}
run();
"
```

## Prerequisites

### Database Setup
- PostgreSQL database running and accessible
- Prisma schema migrated and up to date
- Organization and branch records exist
- Super admin user exists for audit trails

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/chapelstack_local"
```

### Dependencies
- NestJS application context
- Prisma Client
- Member ID Generation Service
- All related modules properly imported

## Performance

### Execution Time
- **Batch Processing**: 50 members per batch for memory efficiency
- **Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes for 1000 members
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with batch processing
- **Database Load**: Distributed across multiple transactions

### Monitoring
The seeder provides real-time progress updates:
- Batch processing status
- Individual member creation confirmations
- Error reporting and handling
- Final summary statistics

## Testing Capabilities

### What You Can Test
- **Member List Views**: Large dataset performance
- **Search Functionality**: Complex queries across indexed data
- **Filtering Systems**: Multiple filter combinations
- **Family Relationships**: Parent-child, spouse connections
- **Analytics Dashboards**: Real engagement metrics
- **Communication Systems**: Preference-based messaging
- **Audit Trails**: Complete change tracking
- **Data Export**: Large dataset exports
- **Performance**: System behavior under load

### Validation
- **Data Integrity**: All relationships properly linked
- **Constraint Compliance**: Foreign keys, unique constraints
- **Business Rules**: Age-appropriate relationships, logical dates
- **GDPR Compliance**: Proper consent and privacy settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Prerequisites**: Ensure organization/branch exist
2. **Database Permissions**: Verify write access to all tables
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size if needed
4. **Timeout Errors**: Increase database connection timeout

### Error Handling
- Individual member creation errors don't stop the entire process
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- Graceful handling of constraint violations
- Rollback capabilities for failed batches

## Data Cleanup

### Removing Seeded Data
```sql
-- WARNING: This will remove ALL seeded data
DELETE FROM audit_log WHERE user_agent = 'ComprehensiveMembersSeeder/1.0';
DELETE FROM member_search_index WHERE member_id IN (SELECT id FROM member WHERE email LIKE '%.%@example.com');
DELETE FROM member_analytics WHERE member_id IN (SELECT id FROM member WHERE email LIKE '%.%@example.com');
-- Continue for all related tables...
DELETE FROM member WHERE email LIKE '%.%@example.com';
```

### Selective Cleanup
Use the audit trail to identify and remove specific seeder runs based on timestamps and user agent strings.

## Integration

### Frontend Testing
The seeded data integrates seamlessly with:
- Member list and grid views
- Advanced search and filtering
- Family relationship displays
- Analytics dashboards
- Communication preference management
- Audit trail viewing

### API Testing
All GraphQL queries and mutations work with seeded data:
- `members` query with large datasets
- `searchMembers` with complex filters
- Member creation and updates
- Relationship management
- Analytics aggregation

## Conclusion

The Comprehensive Member Seeder provides a robust foundation for testing and demonstrating the full capabilities of the enhanced Member Management system. With 1000 realistic members and all supporting data, you can thoroughly validate system performance, user experience, and data integrity across all features.
